# Marketplace style application API

## General idea

Create an API which can handle all the data in database(H2 in memory for starters, later PostgreSQL or similar)

## Functionalities

- Read/Write items to database
- Endpoint to create user
- Endpoint to authenticate user
- All other endpoints that would be needed for the frontend application(Angular probably)
